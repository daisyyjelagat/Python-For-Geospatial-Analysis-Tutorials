## ABOUT THIS CHAPTER

This Chapter Introduces Basic Programming Concepts, information about a Programming Environment and How to Install Python

### PYTHON ESSENTIALS
 Python is one of the programming languages that is often available as an extension to many pieces of scientific software. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software such as QGIS or ArcGIS now include a Python interpreter built in to the software, where youâ€™re able to use Python to interact with your GIS objects. This kind of connection to other software allows you to extend the ways the software packages work, and customize solutions for your specific data analyis needs.

#### Jupyter Notebooks: Code and documentation combined
Jupyter Notebooks are an application that combines source code with rich-text documentation, equations, images, and plots in the form of a single interactive document (Figure 1.9). The Jupyter Notebooks (having a filename extension .ipynb) are divided into cells, where each cell contains part of the document intended for either source code or documentation
